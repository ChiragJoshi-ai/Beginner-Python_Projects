🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple Python console game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

📌 How the Game Works

The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.

The player is repeatedly asked to guess the number.

After each guess, the program gives feedback:

Too Low – if the guess is smaller than the number

Too High – if the guess is larger than the number

Correct!! – when the player guesses correctly

The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

Invalid (non-numeric) input is handled safely.

🧠 Features

Random number generation

Infinite loop until correct guess

Input validation using try-except

Beginner-friendly logic
