🔳 QR Code Generator (Beginner Friendly)

This project demonstrates how a simple Python program can generate a QR code from user input such as a website URL or plain text.

It is included here to help beginners understand how real-world utilities can be built using basic Python concepts and a small external library.

👶 Who Should Try This

Beginners learning Python

Students curious about small real-world tools

Anyone exploring how libraries are used in Python

🧠 What This Project Teaches

Taking user input in Python

Cleaning input using .strip()

Using external libraries

Working with objects and methods

Saving generated output as a file

🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x

qrcode library

Install the required library using:

pip install qrcode[pil]

▶️ How to Run

Clone or download the repository

Open the terminal in the project folder

Run the program:

python filename.py


Enter:

Website URL or text

Filename (make sure to add .png or .jpg)

The QR code image will be saved in the same folder.

🎨 Customization

You can easily customize the QR code by changing:

fill_color

back_color

box_size

border

This helps beginners experiment and see instant visual results.

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project reflects an early learning stage where:

The focus is on understanding logic

Code is kept simple and readable

Learning is prioritized over perfection

It shows beginners that even small scripts can be useful and fun.

📌 Note

Always remember to include the file extension (.png or .jpg) while saving the QR code.
